                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Sensory Outlet was founded in 2025 with a simple mission: to provide resources and support for individuals with sensory processing needs. Our organization began as a small community group and has since grown to serve hundreds of people in our area.</p>
                    <p>Our founders recognized the gap in services for people with sensory sensitivities and decided to create a space where individuals and families could find resources, community, and understanding.</p>
